A Product Key has a length of 29, while it consists out of five fields seperated by a dash (-), 
where each field consists out of five characters. So there are four dashes.
Example Product Key:
BBBBB-CCCCC-DDDDD-FFFFF-GGGGG

The alphabet is fixed. Although there is no 'N' in the alphabet it will appear at some point in the Product Key.

Since we know there are 25 characters and furthermore one will be an 'N' tho not it is not belonging to the alphabet,
we will have a(n outer) counter of 24 (iterations).
